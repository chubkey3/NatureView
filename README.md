## What is it?

NatureView is a website for sharing and viewing images of nature! It uses Next.js, Prisma, and MySQL under the hood and originally started as a project for my mom and I to share our outdoor adventures with one another. If you are interested, the website can be viewed [here](https://natureview.chubkey.com)!

## Features
- Uploading, editing, and deleting images with highly simplified UI
- Image tagging to easily group pictures into certain categories
- Searching and filtering to streamline your results
- Custom slideshow feature to enjoy a quick scenic dive into nature (coming soon)
- Open source & made with ❤️
